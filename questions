1. How should databases be displayed to the client:
I.E:

NAME 	IP				LAST_KNOWN_STATUS
DB0 	192.168.0.1 	ALIVE
DB1		192.168.0.2		ALIVE
DB2		192.168.0.3		ALIVE

INDEX COUNT: 5032
CURRENT_ACTIVE_USERS: 23 

2. Database should not know the client. How to encrypt for sender ? (pass in the pk via message)
